# **MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis**
*mini description*


## Overview of Project:
#### *Purpose:*


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG:

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

*vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, and AWD*

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

*No, the slop of the linear model is not considered to be zero due to the p-value.*

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

*Yes (sort-of). The linear model will correctly predit mpg of MechaCar prototypes approximatly 71% of the time. This prediction comes from the Multiple R-Square. The Adjusted R-Squared is approximatly 68%. In addition to the 6 factors used in this model, there could be additional factors that would affect the prediction of MechaCar prototypes. Ultimatly, the effectiveness should be compared to a predetermined goal/measure of effectiveness.*

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils:

1. The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
